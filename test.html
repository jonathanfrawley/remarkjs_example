# What is Hamilton?
- Hamilton is a High Performance Computing (HPC) machine
  - "HPC" means it is suitable for large scale parallel calculations - making use of multiple CPU cores at the same time
  - CPU cores are the “brains” of a computer. One core can run one program at a time, more cores means you can run more programs at the same time 
- It is useful for running…
  - large numbers of programs using one core each
  - programs using many cores each
  - and everything in between.

# What is Hamilton?
- Hamilton is made up from many servers, each with multiple CPU cores and their own memory, called compute nodes
  - Non-specialist programs (e.g. serial or multi-threaded) can be run on Hamilton,  but can only make use of the resources belonging to a single compute node
- Multiple compute nodes are connected together via a high performance network
  - Specially-written programs can be used to make use of this, allowing a single calculation to be distributed across multiple compute nodes

# What is Hamilton?
Why would I use such a machine?

- Impatience:
  - To make a calculation run more quickly
  - To run lots of calculations at the same time

- Ambition:
  - To be able to tackle large problems that don’t fit inside the memory of a single computer
